# PartY
PartY is a Unity C# networking solution targeted towards party games/large scale matchmaking with small scale gameplay. This solution aims to avoid any third party connections so that there are no fees or limitations to the host.

This project is a work in progress and will be updated for a bit until it is completed.

# Details
This project is under active development and releases will not be available until there is a working version of the solution.
