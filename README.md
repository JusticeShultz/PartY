#   
PartY (pronounced the same as the word party), is a Unity C# networking solution targeted towards party games/large scale matchmaking with small scale gameplay. This solution aims to avoid any third party connections so that there are no fees or limitations to the host of the server. Additionally all that is required to host a server is port forwarding your set port (Default is 27015, the same as Source servers).

***This project is a work in progress and is by no means complete or fully functioning. See the Projects tab for a better idea of where the project is at and what bugs are currently known.***


# Getting started with using PartY

### Server
PartY's server solution is built within .NET Core 2.1. To get started, grab the latest release. Unzip the server into a folder. If you want to allow players to join over the net, port forward to port 27015. Once you are ready, run the executable.

If you are developing, pull the repository and open up the server in visual studio/vs code (or whatever dev environment you are planning to use). Once you have the solution open, make sure it compiles. From here, you should have access to all code needed to add on to or modify the current state of the server.


### Client
PartY's client solution is built within Unity 2019.2.6f
