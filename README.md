# PartY
PartY (pronounced the same as the word party) is a Unity C# networking solution targeted towards party games/large scale matchmaking with small scale gameplay. This solution aims to avoid any third party connections so that there are no fees or limitations to the host of the server. Additionally all that is required to host a server is port forwarding your set port (Default is 27015, the same as Source servers).

***This project is a work in progress and is by no means complete or fully functioning. See the Projects tab for a better idea of where the project is at and what bugs are currently known.***
